This is a BBEdit clippings set for working with SASS documents; 
it includes mixins for SASS, Compass, and Blueprint (via Compass).

All of the clippings include the mixin options enumerated.  
Just tab and use the one you want.


Usage:

Place the SASS.sass directory in ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Clippings/

Clippings Split for new release of HAML/SASS/Compass

  HAML.haml
  SASS.sass

Are for the new versions of HAML/SASS (3.0.0+) and Compass (0.10.0)

  SASS2.sass

Is for working with Sass2 (Haml 2.2.24) and Compass 0.8.17.  

I probably will do a SASS.sccs conversion when SASS.sass is finished.


Good Luck!

Matt
