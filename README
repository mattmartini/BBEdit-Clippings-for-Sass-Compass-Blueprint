This is a BBEdit clippings set for working with SASS documents; 
it includes mixins for SASS, Compass, and Blueprint (via Compass).

Usage:

Place the SASS.sass directory in ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Clippings/

Note, this is for working with Sass2 (Haml 2.2.23) and Compass 0.8.17.  
A new fork for Haml 3 and Compass 0.10 is in progress.

Good Luck!

Matt
